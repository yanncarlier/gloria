API around the creation of Avatars, graphical representation of users or the user's character or persona and digital representations of objects.
It may take either a two-dimensional form as an icon in Internet forums and other on-line communities or a multi-dimensional form, as in games or virtual worlds.

The main purpose is to create a solution for a strong identification method based on user data, to be used optionally on block-chains as a prove of identification, activity, signature ...

User data examples: biometric meta data, prove of residence and other documentations. identity cards and passports related data...

The purpose of this project is to solve the need for trusting as less as possible a 3rd party, for example, an Oracle, when interacting with a blockchain.

Setting a combination of 3 different methods and simultaneous of Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA).

1 - A voice password (a secret repeated 3 times on a mic) pattern recognition will deduct always the same output for the same word and the same person only.

2 - Fingerprint

3 - And Face or Eye (iris) recognition

This 3 biometric inputs must be done simultaneously and will only be stored temporarily and locally.

The private key is generated locally

on the fly and it will be used to validate or sign a transaction, at that precise moment and deleted as immediately as possible.

This ephemeral state guarantees ownership.

To generate the same output the 3 conditions above listed must meet again.
